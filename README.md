My latest attempt at making a game.

I want to develop my abilities better and add new features to my game and coding skill.
Purely as an exercise for my self and If anyone might find it useful, then good for them.

FEATURES:
- Menues
- More upgrades
- Spawn manager for enemies
- Random obstacles.
- Graphics, tilesets
- Sounds?
- basic animation?


This game requires the GameOperatingSystem to function. compile it an add it as an external jar to the project.
